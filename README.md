This repository contains a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, built using HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game was created by following the tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-rock-paper-scissors-game), which you can find here.

Overview
The game's user interface was styled and structured using HTML5 and CSS. The game's logic, such as determining the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's random choice, is performed using JavaScript.

This project was primarily created to help me practice and improve my JavaScript skills.

Future Enhancements
Looking forward, I plan to incorporate several new features to enhance gameplay and user experience, including:

A timer to add a sense of urgency and challenge to the game
Animation to reveal the computer's choice, for added suspense and interactivity
Responsive design to ensure the game is playable and visually appealing on all screen sizes
Your feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to improve this game!
